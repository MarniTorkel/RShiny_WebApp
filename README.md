# RShiny_WebApp
This is my capstone project. 
The application performs the following tasks:
 Determine key influential actors
Visualisation for this task includes node-link diagram for co-starring
network, Sunburst diagram for actors and directors collaboration
pattern, bar graph for actor’s genre trend, small multiple for actor’s
temporal dynamic collaboration.
 Identify genre trends in movies
Visualisation for this task includes bi-partite network for movies and
genres, Wordcloud layout for genre frequency and Streamgraph layout
